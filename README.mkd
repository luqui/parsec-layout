These are layout combinators by Edward Kmett.  First appeared here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/3023615/33796

I've made some modifications and bugfixes.

* Fixed a bug which didn't allow a layout block to start at column 0 (because
it would never be allowed to end).
* Use a `HasLayoutEnv` class for the state instead of a plain `LayoutEnv` in
Parsec's user state parameter, so that this can be composed with other parsers
that use user state.
